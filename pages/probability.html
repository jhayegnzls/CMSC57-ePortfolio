                    <p class="about-text" style="width: 1080px;">While we were also exploring Probability in our STATS1 course and I already had some prior knowledge of the topic, diving deeper into it in this context was both refreshing and enlightening. I came to understand that Probability equips us with the tools to measure and reason about uncertainty. From basic finite probability concepts to more advanced ideas such as Bayes' Theorem, the journey was both intellectually stimulating and, at times, challenging.
                    <br> <br>
                    Although I initially found it difficult to grasp certain aspects, with practice and continued learning, I began to enjoy solving probability-related problems. As a result, I have developed a strong foundational understanding that now enables me to analyze risk, make informed predictions, and interpret chances more accurately. This formal knowledge has helped me structure what were previously intuitive or informal thought processes.

                    <p class="about-text" style="width: 1080px;">What stood out to me the most is how widely applicable Probability is in everyday life. For example, it can be used to evaluate drop rates or spawn rates in games, to understand lottery odds, or even to assess stock market success—highlighting how probability plays a crucial role in decision-making under uncertainty.
                    <br> <br>
                    Personally, I’ve found myself using probability to make more informed everyday decisions, such as whether to bring an umbrella based on weather forecasts or estimating my chances of passing an exam—a habit I’ve developed for every test. Studying probability has given me a structured, logical framework to better understand these situations and make reasoned choices, rather than relying purely on guesswork or
