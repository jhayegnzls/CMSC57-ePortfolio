                    <p class="about-text" style="width: 1080px;">As someone who generally enjoys topics with strong visual components, I initially found the study of graphs appealing and engaging. The topic began with promise and seemed well-suited to my learning preferences. However, as we delved into more complex subtopics, I found myself increasingly confused and began questioning the purpose and utility of some of the concepts.
                    <br> <br>
                    Despite the challenges and moments of confusion, I experienced a great deal of satisfaction when the ideas finally started to make sense. The process of working through difficult graph problems became rewarding, and I developed a genuine appreciation for the structure and logic involved in this area of mathematics. Ultimately, I realized that Graph Theory, though initially overwhelming, is both intellectually stimulating and highly applicable.

                <div>
                    <h2 class="about-subtitle">Real Life applications</h2>

                    <p class="about-text" style="width: 1080px;">What made this topic particularly meaningful for me was discovering its relevance in everyday tasks. For instance, I recently applied concepts from graph theory when planning out my day. By treating each location I needed to visit as a vertex and the paths between them as edges, I was able to determine the most efficient route. This helped minimize travel time and ensured I could move from one place to another with optimal efficiency.
                    <br> <br>
                    This simple yet practical example demonstrated how graph theory can be used to solve real-world problems involving routing, scheduling, and optimization. It gave me a new perspective on how seemingly abstract mathematical concepts can have tangible, day-to-day applications.
