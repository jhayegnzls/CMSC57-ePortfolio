                    <p class="about-text" style="width: 1080px;">At the beginning of the course, when the topic of "Counting" was first introduced, I mistakenly assumed it referred to the basic act of counting numbers—perhaps with a slight twist. However, as the lessons progressed, I quickly realized that the concept was far more intricate and foundational than I initially believed.
                    <br> <br>
                    Through this topic, I learned that Counting in mathematics is fundamentally about determining the number of possible ways events can occur. It is a powerful tool for analyzing and solving problems efficiently, rather than relying on exhaustive or brute-force methods. As I delved deeper, I came to appreciate how critical it is in various problem-solving scenarios.
                    <br> <br>
                    I gained a solid understanding of key concepts such as permutations, combinations, and the pigeonhole principle. These ideas enhanced my logical reasoning and helped me develop a more systematic approach to tackling problems. Overall, learning about Counting has significantly improved my analytical thinking and taught me how to simplify problems by identifying their underlying structures.

                <div>
                    <h2 class="about-subtitle">Real Life applications</h2>

                    <p class="about-text" style="width: 1080px;">Beyond theory, I also discovered how relevant the topic of Counting is in everyday situations. Concepts like permutations and combinations are especially useful when creating schedules, planning events, or even choosing strong passwords. For instance, understanding how to calculate the number of possible arrangements or selections allows me to approach these tasks more logically and efficiently—something I previously overcomplicated. This practical aspect of Counting has made me more mindful of the structures and patterns in daily decision-making.
